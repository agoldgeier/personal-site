	<p>Of my ever-shifting roles at Hinge, one was the most fun to talk about: the few months when my only responsibility was to ponder how dating works (How long should I wait before double-texting? Should someone admit that they're a stoner on their profile? Is fried chicken more attractive than veganism?). I was in a unique position to actually answer these questions, and as we started publishing these kinds of answers, more questions started streaming in, and I ended up in charge of supplying all of the statistics to the first-ever data-based dating advice column: <a target="_blank" href="hingeirl.com">Hinge IRL</a>.</p> 
	<p>It was really fun while it lasted, but eventually we realized that it was more important for me to maintain Hinge's data infrastructure than it was for me to statistically tell the public whether you'll get more matches if you refer to your dog as a doggo or a pupper — so if you click that link above and it looks funky or errors out, it's because we shut down that project toward the end of 2017.</p>
	<p>Anyway, I've collected some of my work here — a lot of this stuff is still fun to comb through, but mostly this is here so it will look really impressive how many high-profile publications my work was published in.</p><br><br>
	<h5>The Biggest Challenge Men Face On Dating Apps</h5>
	<p>After a few months of doing this stuff, I was able to synthesize my experience into this personal-essay-edited-to-look-like-an-interview: <a target="_blank" href="https://hingeirl.com/hinge-reports/whats-the-biggest-challenge-men-face-on-dating-apps-a-qa-with-aviv-goldgeier-junior-growth-engineer/">LINK</a>. And then it got picked up by <a target="_blank" href="https://qz.com/1051462/these-statistics-show-why-its-so-hard-to-be-an-average-man-on-dating-apps/">Quartz</a>, so that's pretty neat.</p><br>
	<h5>"It's Official: Fried Chicken Can Find You Love"</h5>
	<p>Perhaps my greatest accomplishment as a data journalist was getting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/love-sex/a9924270/its-official-fried-chicken-can-find-you-love/">Cosmo</a> to run an article espousing the virtues of fried chicken. Also picked up by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foodandwine.com/news/want-impress-your-date-dinner-order-fried-chicken">Food & Wine</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://mashable.com/2017/05/23/hinge-first-date-data/#Gn8_0mxSyiqz">Mashable</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/stevens/ct-friday-balancing-chicago-first-dates-0602-20170602-column.html">Chicago Tribune</a>, of all places, as well as about a dozen other publications.</p><br>
	<h5>Don't be Afraid of Double-Texting</h5>
	<p>It turns out that if you send an opening message, you're basically in the clear to follow up on it after only about 4 hours. This was best covered by <a target="blank" href="https://qz.com/995174/how-long-should-you-wait-before-sending-a-second-text/">Quartz</a>, but we also saw some international appeal with this one with coverage in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cosmopolitan.nl/liefde-en-sex/news/a159532/onderzoek-na-zo-lang-wachten-op-zijn-reactie-gaat-hij-je-echt-niet-meer-terug-appen/">The Netherlands</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bt.dk/sex-og-parforhold/desperat-eller-dedikeret-derfor-kan-to-smser-i-traek-vaere-godt">Denmark</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiatimes.com/health/tips-tricks/texting-a-second-time-after-being-ignored-the-first-time-around-can-lead-to-more-dates-323301.html">India</a>. Good stuff.</p><br>
	<h5>Other Collected Coverage</h5>
	<p><a target="_blank" href="https://thepointsguy.com/2017/07/travel-photos-help-dating-profiles/">Here's The Points Guy</a> relaying my advice for guys to take Oktoberfest pictures. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.refinery29.com/2017/06/160002/online-dating-vices-hinge-drinking-drugs">Here's Refinery29</a> passing it on that drinking and doing drugs really does make you cool. And <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bustle.com/p/does-where-you-went-to-college-matter-in-dating-theres-good-news-for-liberal-arts-grads-says-hinge-81492">here's Bustle</a> informing the public that men who went to small liberal arts schools get the most likes, though the didn't include the part about Virginia colleges being the most incestuous.</p><br>
	<p>Well that's about it — there's obviously a lot more that I found out that we didn't get to publish because of brand image or whatever, and unfortunately that's all the funniest stuff, but I hope you've enjoyed your daily dose of pulp editorial hogwash</p>
